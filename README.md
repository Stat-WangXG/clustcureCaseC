# clustcureCaseC

R code and data for analysis of 'Case-cohort studies for clustered failure time data with a cure fraction'.


This package fits a promotion time cure model for clustered failure time data under the Case-cohort study, where the unknown baseline distribution function is approximated by the Bernstein polynomial. In this case-cohort design, the covariates can be considered as missing at random. This package employs the inverse probability weighting to construct the likelihood function.
